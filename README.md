### Discord

If you don't have a GitHub account and want to report issues or want to join the community you can join the official 7TV Discord using the link here: <https://discord.com/invite/7tv>.

### AVIF Support

When building Chatterino 7, you might not have access to a static build of `libavif`. In that case, you can define `CHATTERINO_NO_AVIF_PLUGIN` in CMake. If you have `qavif.so` from [kimageformats](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats) installed on your system, Chatterino will pick it up and use AVIF images.

## Git blame

This project has big commits in the history which for example update all line
endings. To improve the output of git-blame, consider setting:

```
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

This will ignore all revisions mentioned in the [`.git-blame-ignore-revs`
file](./.git-blame-ignore-revs). GitHub does this by default.

## Code style

The code is formatted using clang format in Qt Creator. [.clang-format](src/.clang-format) contains the style file for clang format.

### Get it automated with QT Creator + Beautifier + Clang Format

1. Download LLVM: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-15.0.5/LLVM-15.0.5-win64.exe
2. During the installation, make sure to add it to your path
3. In QT Creator, select `Help` > `About Plugins` > `C++` > `Beautifier` to enable the plugin
4. Restart QT Creator
5. Select `Tools` > `Options` > `Beautifier`
6. Under `General` select `Tool: ClangFormat` and enable `Automatic Formatting on File Save`
7. Under `Clang Format` select `Use predefined style: File` and `Fallback style: None`

Qt creator should now format the documents when saving it.

## Doxygen

Doxygen is used to generate project information daily and is available [here](https://doxygen.chatterino.com).
