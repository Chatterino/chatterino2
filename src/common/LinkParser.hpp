/// @brief Represents a parsed link
///
/// A parsed link is represented as views over the source string for its
/// different segments. In this simplified model, a link consists of an optional
/// @a protocol, a mandatory @a host and an optional @a rest. These segments are
/// always next to eachother in the input string, however together, they don't
/// span the whole input as it could contain prefixes or suffixes.
///
/// Prefixes and suffixes are almost identical to the ones in GitHub Flavored
/// Markdown (GFM - https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-).
/// The main differences are that '_' isn't a valid suffix and parentheses
/// aren't counted (e.g. "(a.com/(foo)! would result in "a.com/(foo").
/// Matching is done case insensitive (e.g. "HTTp://a.com" would be valid).
///
/// A @a protocol can either be empty, "http://", or "https://".
/// A @a host can either be an IPv4 address or a hostname. The hostname must end
/// in a valid top level domain. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on it.
/// The @a rest can start with an optional port followed by either a '/', '?',
/// or '#'.
///
/// @b Example
