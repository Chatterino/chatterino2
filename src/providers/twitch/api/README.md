# Twitch API

this folder describes what sort of API requests we do, what permissions are required for the requests etc

## Helix

Full Helix API reference: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference

### Adding support for a new endpoint

If you're adding support for a new endpoint, these are the things you should know.

1. Add a virtual function in the `IHelix` class. Naming should reflect the API name as best as possible.
1. Override the virtual function in the `Helix` class.
1. Mock the function in the `mock::Helix` class in the `mocks/include/mocks/Helix.hpp` file.
1. (Optional) Make a new error enum for the failure callback.

For a simple example, see the `updateUserChatColor` function and its error enum `HelixUpdateUserChatColorError`.
The API is used in the "/color" command in [CommandController.cpp](../../../controllers/commands/CommandController.cpp)

## PubSub

### Whispers

We listen to the `whispers.<user_id>` PubSub topic to receive information about incoming whispers to the user

No EventSub alternative available.

### Chat Moderator Actions

We listen to the `chat_moderator_actions.<user_id>.<channel_id>` PubSub topic to receive information about incoming moderator events in a channel.

We listen to this topic in every channel the user is a moderator.

No complete EventSub alternative available yet. Some functionality can be pieced together but it would not be zero cost, causing the `max_total_cost` of 10 to cause issues.

- For showing bans & timeouts: `channel.ban`, but does not work with moderator token???
- For showing unbans & untimeouts: `channel.unban`, but does not work with moderator token???
- Clear/delete message: not in eventsub, and IRC doesn't tell us which mod performed the action
- Roomstate (slow(off), followers(off), r9k(off), emoteonly(off), subscribers(off)) => not in eventsub, and IRC doesn't tell us which mod performed the action
- VIP added => not in eventsub, but not critical
- VIP removed => not in eventsub, but not critical
- Moderator added => channel.moderator.add eventsub, but doesn't work with moderator token
- Moderator removed => channel.moderator.remove eventsub, but doesn't work with moderator token
- Raid started => channel.raid eventsub, but cost=1 for moderator token
- Unraid => not in eventsub
- Add permitted term => not in eventsub
- Delete permitted term => not in eventsub
- Add blocked term => not in eventsub
- Delete blocked term => not in eventsub
- Modified automod properties => not in eventsub
- Approve unban request => cannot read moderator message in eventsub
- Deny unban request => not in eventsub

### AutoMod Queue

We listen to the `automod-queue.<moderator_id>.<channel_id>` PubSub topic to receive information about incoming automod events in a channel.

We listen to this topic in every channel the user is a moderator.

No EventSub alternative available yet.

### Channel Point Rewards

We listen to the `community-points-channel-v1.<channel_id>` PubSub topic to receive information about incoming channel points redemptions in a channel.

The EventSub alternative requires broadcaster auth, which is not a feasible alternative.

There is no EventSub alternative available yet.
